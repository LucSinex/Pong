General Idea: Space themed, complex pong

Different weapons: Blackhole, explosive missile

Mechanics:
- Works like a normal pong game, but there are floaty space physics, orbital mechanics etc.
- players can shoot weapons which detonate and alter path of ball
- detonations are limited to middle range of playing field
- players can attack each other with debilitating weapons (EMP gun makes player unable to move, for ex.)
